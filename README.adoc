= Consuming RESTful services using the reactive JAX-RS client

[.hidden]
NOTE: This repository contains the guide documentation source. To view the guide in published form, view it on the https://openliberty.io/guides/{projectid}.html[Open Liberty website].

Learn how to use a reactive JAX-RS client to asynchronously invoke RESTful microservices over HTTP.

== What you'll learn

You'll first learn how to create a reactive JAX-RS client application using the default JAX-RS reactive provider APIs.
You will then learn how to improve the application to take advantage of the RxJava reactive extensions with a
pluggable reactive provider that's published by https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey[Eclipse Jersey^].
The JAX-RS client is an API used to communicate with RESTful web services. 
The API makes it easy to consume a web service that is exposed by using the HTTP protocol,
which means that you can efficiently implement client-side applications. 
The reactive client extension to JAX-RS is an API that enables you to use the reactive programming model when using the JAX-RS client.

Reactive programming is an extension of asynchronous programming and focuses on the flow of data through data streams. 
Reactive applications process data when it becomes available and respond to requests as soon as processing is complete. 
The request to the application and response from the application are decoupled so that
the application is not blocked from responding to other requests in the meantime. 
Because reactive applications can run faster than synchronous applications, they provide a much smoother user experience.

The application in this guide demonstrates how the JAX-RS client accesses remote RESTful services by using asynchronous method calls. 
You’ll first look at the supplied client application that uses the JAX-RS default `CompletionStage`-based provider. 
Then, you’ll modify the client application to use Jersey’s RxJava provider, which is an alternative JAX-RS reactive provider. 
Both Jersey and Apache CXF provide third-party reactive libraries for RxJava and were tested for use in Open Liberty.

The application that you will be working with consists of three microservices, `system`, `inventory`, and `query`. 
Every 15 seconds, the `system` microservice calculates and publishes an event that contains its current average system load. 
The `inventory` microservice subscribes to that information so that it can keep an updated list of all the systems
and their current system loads.

image::QueryService.png[Reactive Query Service, width=253, height=327, align="center"]

The microservice that you will modify is the `query` service. It communicates with the `inventory` service 
to determine which system has the highest system load and which system has the lowest system load.

The `system` and `inventory` microservices use MicroProfile Reactive Messaging to send and receive the system load events.
If you want to learn more about reactive messaging, see the 
https://openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-reactive-messaging.html[Creating reactive Java microservices^] guide.

== Additional prerequisites

You need to have Docker installed.
For installation instructions, refer to the official https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[Docker documentation^].
You will build and run the microservices in Docker containers.
An installation of Apache Kafka is provided in another Docker container.

== Creating a web client using the default JAX-RS API

InventoryClient.java
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::defaultrx/query/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/query/client/InventoryClient.java[]
----

Navigate to the `start` directory to begin.

JAX-RS provides a default reactive provider that you can use to create a reactive REST client using the `CompletionStage` interface.

Create an [hotspot file=0]`InventoryClient` class, which is used to retrieve inventory data,
and a [hotspot file=1]`QueryResource` class, which queries data from the `inventory` service.

[role="code_command hotspot file=0", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `InventoryClient` interface.#
`query/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/query/client/InventoryClient.java`
----

The [hotspot=getSystem file=0]`getSystem()` method returns the `CompletionStage` interface. 
This interface represents a unit or stage of a computation.
When the associated computation completes, the value can be retrieved. 
The [hotspot=rx file=0]`rx()` method calls the `CompletionStage` interface. 
It retrieves the `CompletionStageRxInvoker` class and allows these methods to
function correctly with the `CompletionStage` interface return type.

[role="code_command hotspot file=1", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `QueryResource` class.#
`query/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/query/QueryResource.java`
----

QueryResource.java
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::defaultrx/query/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/query/QueryResource.java[]
----

The [hotspot=systemLoadMethod file=1]`systemLoad` endpoint asynchronously processes the data that is
retrieved by the [hotspot=getsystem file=1]`InventoryClient` interface and serves that data after all of the services respond. 
The [hotspot=thenAcceptAsync file=1]`thenAcceptAsync()` and [hotspot=exceptionally file=1]`exceptionally()`
methods together behave like an asynchronous try-catch block. 
The data is processed in the [hotspot=thenAcceptAsync file=1]`thenAcceptAsync()` method only after the `CompletionStage` interface finishes retrieving it. 
When you return a `CompletionStage` type in the resource, it doesn’t necessarily mean that the computation completed and the response was built.

A [hotspot=countdownlatch file=1]`CountDownLatch` object is used to track how many asynchronous requests are being waited on. 
After each thread is completed, the [hotspot=countdown1 hotspot=countdown2 file=1]`countdown()` method
counts the [hotspot=countdownlatch file=1]`CountDownLatch` object down towards `0`. 
This means that the value returns only after the thread that's retrieving the value is complete.
The [hotspot=await file=1]`await()` method stops and waits until all of the requests are complete. 
While the countdown completes, the main thread is free to perform other tasks. 
In this case, no such task is present.

== Building and running the application

The `system`, `inventory`, and `query` microservices will be built in Docker containers. 
If you want to learn more about Docker containers,
check out the https://openliberty.io/guides/containerize.html[Containerizing microservices^] guide.

Start your Docker environment.

To build the application, run the Maven `install` and `package` goals from the command-line session in the `start` directory:

[role='command']
```
mvn -pl models install
mvn package
```

include::{common-includes}/ol-full-docker-pull.adoc[]

Run the following commands to containerize the microservices:

[role='command']
```
docker build -t system:1.0-SNAPSHOT system/.
docker build -t inventory:1.0-SNAPSHOT inventory/.
docker build -t query:1.0-SNAPSHOT query/.
```

Next, use the provided script to start the application in Docker containers.
The script creates a network for the containers to communicate with each other.
It creates containers for Kafka, Zookeeper, and all of the microservices in the project.

// Static guide instruction
ifndef::cloud-hosted[]
include::{common-includes}/os-tabs.adoc[]

[.tab_content.windows_section]
--
[role='command']
```
.\scripts\startContainers.bat
```
--
[.tab_content.mac_section.linux_section]
--
[role='command']
```
./scripts/startContainers.sh
```
--

The services will take some time to become available.
You can access the application by making requests to the `query/systemLoad` endpoint at the
http://localhost:9080/query/systemLoad[http://localhost:9080/query/systemLoad^] URL. 
endif::[]

// Cloud hosted guide instruction
ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
```
./scripts/startContainers.sh
```
{: codeblock}

The services will take some time to become available.
You can access the application by using the following `curl` command:

```
curl http://localhost:9080/query/systemLoad
```
{: codeblock}
endif::[]

When the service is ready, you see an output similar to the following example. 
This example was formatted for readability:

[source, role='no_copy']
----
{ 
    "highest": {
        "hostname":"30bec2b63a96",       
        ”systemLoad": 6.1
    },     
    "lowest": { 
        "hostname":"55ec2b63a96",    
        ”systemLoad": 0.1
    }
}
----

The JSON output contains a `highest` attribute that represents the system with the highest load.
Similarly, the `lowest` attribute represents the system with the lowest load. 
The JSON output for each of these attributes contains the `hostname` and `systemLoad` of the system.

When you are done checking out the application, run the following command to stop the `query` microservice. 
Leave the `system` and `inventory` services running because they will be used when the application is rebuilt later in the guide:

[role='command']
```
docker stop query
```


== Updating the web client to use an alternative reactive provider

pom.xml
[source, xml, linenums, role="code_column"]
----
include::finish/query/pom.xml[]
----

Although JAX-RS provides the default reactive provider that returns `CompletionStage` types,
you can alternatively use another provider that supports other reactive frameworks like https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava[RxJava^]. 
The Apache CXF and Eclipse Jersey projects produce such providers.
You'll now update the web client to use the Jersey reactive provider for RxJava. 
With this updated reactive provider, you can write clients that use RxJava objects instead of clients that use only the `CompletionStage` interface. 
These custom objects provide a simpler and faster way for you to create scalable RESTful services with a `CompletionStage` interface.

[role="code_command hotspot file=0", subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the Maven configuration file.#
`query/pom.xml`
----

The [hotspot=jerseyRxjava file=0]`jersey-rx-client-rxjava` and
[hotspot=jerseyRxjava2 file=0]`jersey-rx-client-rxjava2` dependencies provide the `RxInvokerProvider` classes,
which are registered to the [hotspot=jerseyClient file=0]`jersey-client` `ClientBuilder` class.

Update the client to accommodate the custom object types that you are trying to return. 
You'll need to register the type of object that you want inside the client invocation.

[role="code_command hotspot file=1", subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the `InventoryClient` interface.#
`query/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/query/client/InventoryClient.java`
----

InventoryClient.java
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/query/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/query/client/InventoryClient.java[]
----

The return type of the [hotspot=getSystem file=1]`getSystem()` method is now an `Observable` object instead of a `CompletionStage` interface. 
http://reactivex.io/RxJava/javadoc/io/reactivex/Observable.html[Observable^] is a
collection of data that waits to be subscribed to before it can release any data and is part of RxJava. 
The [hotspot=rx file=1]`rx()` method now needs to contain `RxObservableInvoker.class` as an argument.
This argument calls the specific invoker, `RxObservableInvoker`, for the `Observable` class that's provided by Jersey. 
In the [hotspot=getSystem file=1]`getSystem()` method,
the [hotspot=register file=1]`register(RxObservableInvokerProvider)` method call registers the `RxObservableInvoker` class,
which means that the client can recognize the invoker provider.

In some scenarios, a producer might generate more data than the consumers can handle. 
JAX-RS can deal with cases like these by using the RxJava `Flowable` class with backpressure. 
To learn more about RxJava and backpressure, see
https://openliberty.io/blog/2019/04/10/jaxrs-reactive-extensions.html[JAX-RS reactive extensions with RxJava backpressure^].

== Updating the REST resource to support the reactive JAX-RS client

QueryResource.java
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/query/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/query/QueryResource.java[]
----

Now that the client methods return the `Observable` class, you must update the resource to accommodate these changes.

[role="code_command hotspot file=0", subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the `QueryResource` class.#
`query/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/query/QueryResource.java`
----

The goal of the [hotspot=systemload file=0]`systemLoad()` method is to return the system with the largest load and the system with the smallest load. 
The `systemLoad` endpoint first gets all of the hostnames by calling the [hotspot=getSystems file=0]`getSystems()` method. 
Then it loops through the hostnames and calls the [hotspot=getSystem file=0]`getSystem()` method on each one.

Instead of using the `thenAcceptAsync()` method,
`Observable` uses the [hotspot=subscribe file=0]`subscribe()` method to asynchronously process data. 
Thus, any necessary data processing happens inside the `subscribe()` method. 
In this case, the necessary data processing is saving the data in the temporary [hotspot=holderClass file=0]`Holder` class.
The `Holder` class is used to store the value that is returned from the client because values cannot be returned inside the `subscribe()` method. 
The highest and lowest load systems are updated in the [hotspot=updateValues file=0]`updateValues()` method.

== Rebuilding and running the application

Run the Maven `install` and `package` goals from the command-line session in the `start` directory:

[role='command']
```
mvn -pl query package
```

Run the following command to containerize the `query` microservice:

[role='command']
```
docker build -t query:1.0-SNAPSHOT query/.
```

Next, use the provided script to restart the query service in a Docker container. 

// Static guide instruction
ifndef::cloud-hosted[]
include::{common-includes}/os-tabs.adoc[]

[.tab_content.windows_section]
--
[role='command']
```
.\scripts\startQueryContainer.bat
```
--
[.tab_content.mac_section.linux_section]
--
[role='command']
```
./scripts/startQueryContainer.sh
```
--

You can access the application by making requests to the `query/systemLoad` endpoint at the
http://localhost:9080/query/systemLoad[http://localhost:9080/query/systemLoad^] URL. 
endif::[]

// Cloud hosted guide instruction
ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
```
./scripts/startQueryContainer.sh
```
{: codeblock}

You can access the application by making requests to the `query/systemLoad` endpoint using
the following `curl` command:

```
curl http://localhost:9080/query/systemLoad
```
{: codeblock}
endif::[]

Switching to a reactive programming model freed up the thread that was handling your request to `query/systemLoad`. 
While the client request is being handled, the thread can handle other work.

When you are done checking out the application, run the following script to stop the application:

// Static guide instruction
ifndef::cloud-hosted[]
include::{common-includes}/os-tabs.adoc[]

[.tab_content.windows_section]
--
[role='command']
```
.\scripts\stopContainers.bat
```
--
[.tab_content.mac_section.linux_section]
--
[role='command']
```
./scripts/stopContainers.sh
```
--
endif::[]


// Cloud hosted guide instruction
ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
```
./scripts/stopContainers.sh
```
{: codeblock}
endif::[]

== Testing the query microservice

A few tests are included for you to test the basic functionality of the `query` microservice. 
If a test failure occurs, then you might have introduced a bug into the code.

[role="code_command hotspot", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `QueryServiceIT` class.#
`query/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/query/QueryServiceIT.java`
----

The [hotspot=testSystemLoad file=0]`testSystemLoad()` test case verifies that the
`query` service can correctly calculate the highest and lowest system loads. 

QueryServiceIT.java
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/query/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/query/QueryServiceIT.java[]

// =================================================================================================

=== Running the tests

Navigate to the `query` directory, then verify that the tests pass by running the Maven `verify` goal:

[role='command']
```
cd query
mvn verify
```

When the tests succeed, you see output similar to the following example:

[source, role='no_copy']
